## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was harder than I imagined. I guess if there was anything I learned it'll be just finding ways to solve problems even though my methods might not be conventional.

### Continued development

- Need to get a could gasp of "blend". Don't really understand it.
- Need to improve on usage of media queries and generally building responsive sites.
